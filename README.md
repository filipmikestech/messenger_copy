# Messenger copy - live coding

Hi! This is my project where I am live coding a copy of Messenger. With **ZERO** edits! So you can watch all my mistakes, all my thinking, and studying. Just raw footage, so you can see how I am solving issues and learn from it, and not just watch some prepared video with all the issues already solved. I believe that many programmers suffer from imposter syndrome, and this is my way of demonstrating that it's okay to make mistakes and not be perfect.

# Watch it on Youtube!

I am making commits based on each video. So you can download each corresponding commit for each video.\
